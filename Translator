# We are going to check if the person actually typed 
# something by using the len() function. Then, we check
# if it is not numbers but letters using the .isalpha() 
# function. We have an input statement. Then, we set the string
# term to lowercase to make things easier. We create variables
# to store the letters of the words. We created first_letter to 
# store the first letter of the word. Later, we arrange final_word to 
# combine the lower case remainder with the first letter with "ay".
# Also, we slice the letters from the first index to the end of the word.
# If these conditions are not met, it prints the statement for else.
