# Pig-Latin-Translator
This program I built uses Python to greet the user and then translate strings inputed by users to translate into Pig Latin. Note: The Pig Latin translator take any word given, moves the first letter to the end of the word, and adds the phrase 'ay' to the end. An example is 'Gordon' becomes 'Ordongay'!
